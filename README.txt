I made this because the instructions page would not show everything I had written.

Press enter to go to the instructions, then here are the instructions that should be displayed:

Navigate the spaceship to each planet with the arrows. Once you collide with a planet, you enter its atmosphere and
are transported to the ground. 

On the ground, press the right arrow to shoot the alien, and the left arrow to go back to space. 
If the alien hits you more than 6 times in all the planets combined, you lose. 

If you kill the alien, wait for the treasure to collide with you and then you add it to your inventory.
Once you collide with the treasure, you are taken back to space.

Jump over the blocks. I have not yet decided what I want to happen if you collide with a block, so you can hit them
currently and it does not matter. But they are there to jump over. 

Get the treasure from each planet without having the alien kill you. 

If you collect the treasure from each planet, you win.

At the instructions screen, choose your character by pressing the left arrow for Fry and the right arrow for Leela.
